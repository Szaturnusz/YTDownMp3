# YT Audio Converter Pro 🎵

![Logo](ytdown.png)

Professional desktop application for converting YouTube videos into high-quality audio files. The program not only downloads but also performs post-processing: it normalizes volume, cuts unnecessary parts (intro/outro), and fills in music data (metadata).

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🚀 Ultra-Fast Downloads:**
    *   **Parallel Playlist Processing:** Downloads up to 5 videos simultaneously from playlists.
    *   **Accelerated Single Downloads:** Uses multi-threaded fragment downloading for maximum speed.

*   **🔊 Advanced Audio Normalization:**
    *   **Consistent Volume:** Uses EBU R128 standard (-13 LUFS) with dynamic range compression.
    *   **No Distortion:** True Peak limiting (-1.0 dBTP) ensures no clipping or crackling.
    *   **Radio-Ready:** Tracks sound uniform and professional, just like on the radio.
*   **✂️ Smart Mode:** Thanks to SponsorBlock integration, it automatically cuts non-music parts from videos (intro, outro, subscription reminders, sponsorships).
*   **🖼️ Metadata & Cover Art:** Automatically downloads and embeds the video's cover art, title, and artist into the file.
*   **📋 Playlist Support:**
