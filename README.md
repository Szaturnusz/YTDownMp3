# YT Audio Converter Pro 🎵

![Logo](ytdown.png)

Professional desktop application for converting YouTube videos into high-quality audio files. The program not only downloads but also performs post-processing: it normalizes volume, cuts unnecessary parts (intro/outro), and fills in music data (metadata).

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🎧 Studio Quality:** Supports MP3, OGG, and AAC formats with up to 320kbps bitrate.
*   **🔊 Audio Normalization:** Brings the volume of all downloaded files to a uniform level (EBU R128 standard), so there won't be quieter or louder tracks in your playlist.
*   **✂️ Smart Mode:** Thanks to SponsorBlock integration, it automatically cuts non-music parts from videos (intro, outro, subscription reminders, sponsorships).
*   **🖼️ Metadata & Cover Art:** Automatically downloads and embeds the video's cover art, title, and artist into the file.
*   **📋 Playlist Support:**
    *   **Single Link:** Converts a single video to audio.
    *   **Playlist Link:** Automatically processes and converts all videos in the playlist to MP3.
*   **🌍 Automatic Language Detection:** The program starts by detecting the system language. Supported languages:
    *   🇬🇧 English (en)
    *   🇭🇺 Hungarian (hu)
    *   🇩🇪 German (de)
    *   🇷🇺 Russian (ru)
